Webhooks notify your service when videos successfully finish processing and are ready to stream or if your video enters an error state.

Whenever a video is ready or faces an error, based on the event you select here, our servers will send a POST request to the URL that you specify here. This provides a notification to your server so that you can take relevant actions e.g. publishing the video on your website or sending notifications to your viewers.
